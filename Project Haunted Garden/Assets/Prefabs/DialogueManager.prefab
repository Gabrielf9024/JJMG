      with her close covered in dirt and bug guts.She finds Ivy lazing around per
      usual, while Lily seems to be waiting for her next to the window at the front
      of the house'

    - "Aloe: Well I am glad I\u2019m not dead too, but I do have a question"
    - 'Aloe: I found it strange that all the bugs seemed to be attracted to your house,
      is there a reason why?'
    - 'Lily: Well that''s a long story, but I could tell you if you would like'
    - 'Aloe: I''m all ears'
    - 'Lily: Well you see I am the only, or was rather, the only daughter of the stargazer
      family'
    - 'Lily: This meant I had a lot of expectations placed on me, mainly I was to
      be the head of my father''s company after his passing, as he did not trust outsiders'
    - 'Lily: You see my father was a manufacturing plant in the city, but I never
      had any interest in that path, I always found comfort in the garden that surrounded
      our home'
    - 'Lily: I would help plant vegetables and trees, my father would scold me but
      that would never stop me from escaping into the garden as if it was another
      world just for me'

      furious'
    - 'Aloe: Wait you were in school for botany, that such a coincidence I''m in school
      for plant biology'
    - 'Lily: Well no wonder you were such a wiz in the garden, I should have known
      you were a fellow green thumb!'
    - 'Ivy: Bark(Well if you too are going to keep telling campfire stories could
      you at least do it a little more quiet, some of us had a rough day) '
